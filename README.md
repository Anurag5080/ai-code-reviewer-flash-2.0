The AI Code Reviewer is a MERN stack project designed to enhance code quality using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash AI. It provides concise and actionable feedback on code, highlighting mistakes and suggesting optimizations to make it more efficient and production-ready. Currently, the project does not include authentication or a database, but these features are planned for future updates. This tool helps developers refine their code by offering precise improvements, making it an invaluable assistant for writing cleaner, more optimized, and industry-standard code.
